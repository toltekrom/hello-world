# hello-world
This is how it starts.
@Slots where quarters are incerted brings to life a world that I could explore, challenge my thinking and response time, and compete for mastery. Exciting games that peaked my interest to digital technology and computers. 1985, so long ago, I watch over my brothers shoulder as he writes in code to create a stickman in the screen of the CRT monitor, that can move by using keyboard cursers. If I had my own computer at that stage in life I would have been programming everyday.
